In today's society, the issue of food waste is becoming increasingly serious. To address this, we have developed an Android app that allows small business owners to sell near-expiry products at discounted prices to consumers. This app enables sellers to reduce inventory losses, allows consumers to purchase fresh food at lower prices, and contributes to environmental protection. Ultimately, this solution benefits sellers, consumers, and the environment alike.

##  Tech
Language:
`Java 17.0.11`

Database:
`Firebase Realtime Database`

Tool:

5. The buyer shows the QR code provided by the app to the seller and receives the food.
